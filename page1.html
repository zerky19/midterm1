        <h1>A black beach of Lake Alakol</h1>
        <p>If you are tired of the regular golden sandy beaches that are everywhere, then it’s high time to get acquainted with the black pebble beach of the Lake Alakol, which is in the south-west of Kazakhstan. The lake has not only an unusual coastline, but also healing powers as well. The black beach attracts people with common cold and skin diseases, nervous breakdown, and all those, who love meditations. Even Soviet cosmonauts used to come to the lake after their flights to get rehabilitated here.</p>
        <img src="alakol.jpg" style="border-radius: 10px;">
        <p>Alakol Nature Reserve was established here to preserve rare types of birds, so you can find famous silver bass in its waters. If you come to the lake at the beginning of May, you can join the many bird watchers that come for the “Wings of Alakol” festival. This event attracts not only bird watchers but also journalists, yoga practitioners, and musicians. This is how a season on Alakol begins. Further is summer - a time of the sun, swimming and water entertainments. In autumn, there is another festival celebrated on the first weekends of September – “Okunkol”, where recreational fishermen catch the famous silver bass.</p>

        <h1>Pink Lake Kobeituz</h1>
        <p>Lake Kobeytuz is a salt lake in Kazakhstan. It is located at an altitude of 253 meters above sea level, on the territory of the Ereymentau District of the Akmola Region, northeast of the city of Ereymentau. The origins of the name come from the local Kazakh language in which "kobei" means multiply and "tuz" means salt.</p>
        <img src="kobeituz.jpg" style="border-radius: 10px;">
        <p>Due to the high concentration of salt, the water of Kobeituz could keep a person afloat, as in the Dead Sea. But swimming in it is unrealistic: the lake is very shallow, the maximum depth is only about 20 cm, that is, you can enter the water only knee-deep. Mostly young people come here for beautiful photographs. Moreover, in order for the color of Kobeituz to be as bright as possible, it is recommended to travel in sunny weather. They say that it is then that microorganisms most actively release their pigment.</p>
